### Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs

Lets take an example of an Arduino Board,An Arduino board is a small computer that you can use to control and interact with electronic devices. It's a physical platform that allows you to write and upload programs (called "sketches") to make things like lights, motors, sensors, and other components work together.
we take an Arduino board since we will be working with something similar, **we will be talking about a field which is lying inside the chip shown below**:

![image](https://github.com/Tawfeeq2507/pes_pd/assets/142083027/0783c87c-1949-4fa8-8a9b-b6fb487ad22c)

- if we want to desgin this particular Arduino board, we can describe it in a form of a block diagram shown below:

![image](https://github.com/Tawfeeq2507/pes_pd/assets/142083027/5f0aa3ef-2b05-414d-9234-ddc4d438b5ec)

- the highlighted area of the chip is nothing but the processor shown above and along with the processors we have all the interfaces that we see around the particular processor.
- This is the typical arduino board diagram looks like.

we wont be talking about the embedded desgin and rather will be looking into the chip desgining.

when we open up the IC it looks something like this shown below:

![image](https://github.com/Tawfeeq2507/pes_pd/assets/142083027/049a19cc-766c-46f6-9879-ca05b3c9ae8b)

what we see above is usually what we call a **"chip"**, but its known as a **"PACKAGE"**, these packages have been assigned with certain names for ex: we see that the above package is named **"QNF-48"**.Similarly there are multiple packages in the market with different flavours and pins.
- Here the pin loacations of the particular package are all given by the particular arduino board.
- the package seen above has a size of 7mm x 7mm

- the main Brain of the package the chip sits in the middle of the package and the way the chip is connected to the package is shown below:

![image](https://github.com/Tawfeeq2507/pes_pd/assets/142083027/9ff58809-bd74-41fa-9043-cb09f788ed90)

- Here we have used **"wire bounds"** to connect the pins to the boundaries of the Chip, In this way we are able to transfer all the signal from outside world into the chip.

When we Open the chip it looks like this shown below:

![image](https://github.com/Tawfeeq2507/pes_pd/assets/142083027/f90561ac-8bc0-4f3f-9ab0-6c4cf846bb62)

- The chip that is shown above has many various components and one of the Important componants is the **"PADs"**.
- **"PADs"** in a chip are like the little metal feet or points on the bottom of the chip. They're used to connect the chip to a circuit through which we can send the outside signal into the chip so it can do its job.
- the Middle free space area seen above inside is known as the **"Core"** of the chip.
- **"Core"** of a chip is like the brain of the chip. It's the central part that does most of the actual thinking and processing of information.Its a place where all our Digital logical sits,ex:AND gate,OR gate,MUXs,etc.
- the size of the chip is known as the **"Die"**.
- **"Die"** is like the heart of a computer chip. It's a tiny, flat piece of silicon that contains the actual electronic circuits. It's where all the important computations and operations happen.This the Die that gets manufactured on the **"Silicon Wafer"**.

The typical **Core** of a CHIP consists of an SoC(we will be working with RISC-V SoC),SRAM,ADCs,DACs,PLL,SPI and couple of components shown below:

![image](https://github.com/Tawfeeq2507/pes_pd/assets/142083027/e88f8c8a-3d09-4555-8b92-89a7bb29b5e9)

- these SRAM,ADC,DAC,PLL all together are known As **"Foundry IP's(Intellectual Properties)"**
- **Foundry** is an important term in chip Designing Chips, all our devices,mobiles,everything is depended on the Foundry's.
- Foundry is a place where the chips are manufactured, Foundry's are set of machines that we communicate with.
- The digital Blocks placed the SoC and the SPI are basically called as **"Macros"**.

### What is RISC-V?
**"RISC-V intruction set architecture"** popularly known as **"ISA"**.It is nothing but a language of the computer,a way through which we are able to talk and communicate with the computers.RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computing (RISC) principles. An instruction set architecture is essentially the set of instructions that a computer's processor can execute. 

For a C program to run on a computer hardware which has got a particular Layout(qFlow), where this layout is nothing but interior of a chip present inside our devices,There are certain flow to pass the C program to the layout.



- here the C program is first compiled in its assembly language program which is nothing but the RISC-V assembly language program.
- this Aseembly language program is then converted into machine language program aka the binary language program(ie: 1's and 0's) which is understood by the hardware of the computer.
- here the codes in hexadecimal format but in real term they are in binary format, therefore this needs to be converted into binary format.
- after converting these bits gets finnaly executed in the layout and get the required output.


Another layer present betweeen the C pragram and the layout is the **"HDL(Hardware discriptive language)"**.

#### What is HDL?
**"HDL"** stands for **Hardware Description Language**. It's a specialized programming language used to describe the structure and behavior of electronic circuits and systems. HDLs are used in the design, simulation, and synthesis of digital circuits, such as those found in microprocessors, memory chips, and other integrated circuits.
There are two main types of HDLs:
 1)**Verilog**: Developed by Phil Moorby and Prabhu Goel in the 1980s
 2)**VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language)**:Developed by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1980s


- To Implement these RISC-V specifications we need **RTL(Register-Transfer Level)**,in this case shown below the RTL used is **picorv32 cpu core**

![image](https://github.com/Tawfeeq2507/pes_pd/assets/142083027/f8e12d12-72af-4d9a-b951-14769924a11f)


- this RTL implments these RISC-V specifications.
- and from here its RTL-GDS flow

### From Software Applications to Hardware 

Any **application software** or aka **"Apps"** run on **Hardware**... but how does this happen??

- First the Application software enters the Blocks called the **System Software**,where the system software intern converts the application program into the binary language.
- the Major components of **"System Software"** concists of the OS(Operating system),Assembler,compiler.
- The **"Opertaing system:** handles lots of things, it handles the IO operations,allocate memory, low level system functions, OS also helps in taking the application program and converting it into its respective assembly language and finally inot binary program that is understood by the hardware.
- The output of the OS are nothing but small functions in the given programs(C++,Java,C,python,etc).
- these are taken by the respective **Compiler** and then converted into intstructions.
- The syntax of these instructions depends on what kind of the hardware is,(ex if the hardware is for intel x86 then the instructions will be of intel x86 only).
- all these instructions all together form the **.exe file**

![image](https://github.com/Tawfeeq2507/pes_pd/assets/142083027/79883606-8f16-453f-a8e0-7ace2b93f68f)

- The job of the **"Assembler"** is to take these instructions and convert it into its respective binary numbers aka **Machine language** program.
- These binary numbers aka machine language is then fed to the hardware, where hardware understands the type of pattern of the machine language and does the respective operation.

This is the flow how the application software runs through many different layers before entering the hardware.

lets take an example of a application of "stop watch".

- the C program for the stop watch enters the compiler and the output of the compiler will be intructions based on the type of the hardware(ex RISC-V) therefore the instructions will be of RISC-V.
- these intructions go into the assembler as a .exe file which gives the output in form of machine language.
- these hexadecimals are converted into binary before entering into the hardware.

![image](https://github.com/Tawfeeq2507/pes_pd/assets/142083027/cd3ff2fc-9fd5-4a77-b1f2-4daa50b6ba1f)

- in general terms these binary numbers are entering into the chip layout and the functions are performed in this layout.

when we take a much deeper look into the program we try to understand the RISC-V intrucstions-

![image](https://github.com/Tawfeeq2507/pes_pd/assets/142083027/ac8b1be7-b508-4ee6-915e-243c495668cf)

- here we see that in left we have the input to the compiler,in the left we have the output of the compiler and the output of the assembler is in hexadecimal in the middle we have assembler output.
- the instructions after the compiler acts as an **"Abstract interface"** between the C language and the hardware, this Abstract interface is called as the **"Instruction set architecture"** or **"Architecture of the computer"**,in the case shown above its the RISC-V architecture.

There is another inteface between the Assembly language and the hardware which is known as the **HDL(Hardware discriptive language**.

#### What is RTL?

RTL stands for Register-Transfer Level. It's a level of abstraction used in digital circuit design and describes how data moves between registers and how operations are performed on that data.In RTL design, the behavior of the digital system is defined by describing how data is transferred between registers and how operations are performed on that data. This is typically done using a hardware description language (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL.

![image](https://github.com/Tawfeeq2507/pes_pd/assets/142083027/52f5c6ce-ea1a-4bf8-8b89-dc223163f440)

- Our hardware only understands 1's and 0's therefore we need An RTL which implements the output of the assembly language that is the machine language into the Hardware.This is known as the RTL implementation of our instruction set.
- This RTL is then Synthesized into a Netlist, where this Synthesized Netlist of the RTL consists of Gates,flip flops,inverters,MUX's,etc.
- and from this Synthesized Netlist to hardware is **Physical design implementation of the Netlist**.

### Introduction to all components of open-source digital asic design

- To implement Digital ASIC design we require certain elements these elements are RTL IP's,EDA Tools,PDK data.

**What is PDK?**

- **"PDK"** a **(Process Design Kit)** is a set of files provided by semiconductor manufacturers to help designers use their fabrication process to create integrated circuits (ICs). It contains a comprehensive set of information, models, and files that enable designers to develop and verify their designs using the specific process technology offered by the manufacturer.


**What is EDA Tools?**

- **EDA** stands for **(Electronic Design Automation)**, and EDA tools refer to a category of software applications and tools used in the design and development of electronic systems, including integrated circuits (ICs), printed circuit boards (PCBs), and other electronic components.EDA tools are essential for designing and testing electronic hardware and ensuring that it functions correctly before it is manufactured.hese tools automate various aspects of the design process, making it more efficient and error-free.

- Therfore for making Open source Digital ASIC Design we have Open source for RTL IP's(librecores.org,opencores.org,github.com,etc),EDA tools(qflow,openROAD,openLANE,etc),PDK(Foss 130nm production PDK).

![image](https://github.com/Tawfeeq2507/pes_pd/assets/142083027/ce2d29cb-02c9-4f40-b68b-3472527cbea1)

- these 3 Elements can be used to achieve 100% open-source Digital ASIC design.

- The methodology is then Implemented Through A Flow, this Flow is nothing but a piece of software known as RTL to GDS2,this is the main objective of the ASIC Design Flow which takes the design from RTL(REgister transfer level) to GDS2 format used for final layout.
